= Concord: coordinate conversion program

Program to convert coordinates between the New Zealand coordinate systems.  

This program represents an assemblage of code.  It is long overdue a 
major rewrite.  

It is recommended that this code is used only for building and running 
the concord program, and not as a basis for any other developments.

Warning: This program will not run correctly on big-endian systems.

== How to Build on UNIX (GNU make)

Note: Build instructions are not available for MS Windows.  Prebuilt 
files for Windows are available at 

http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/software-downloads/snap

- Change directory to the unix subdirectory of the concord source directory

- Make concord

	make

- Test concord

	make test

  The output from this should end "All tests passed"

- Install concord (this may require root privileges)

	make install

  This installs concord into /usr/local/share/concord, and creates a symbolic
  link in /usr/local/bin/concord (see Makefile to change these locations)

You can also use "make clean" to remove the build files, and "make uninstall"
to remove the installed files
